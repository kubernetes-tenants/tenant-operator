Simple, right?</p><p>The project was originally called <strong>&quot;TenantOperator&quot;</strong> - yeah, not the catchiest name, I know. I started building it because I had a specific problem: I needed to automatically provision full Kubernetes workloads in real-time whenever new tenants showed up in the database. Not sure how common that use case is, but it was absolutely critical for what I was building.</p><h2 id="how-it-evolved" tabindex="-1">How It Evolved <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-it-evolved" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How It Evolved&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Here&#39;s the thing - as I kept working on it, I realized this wasn&#39;t just about tenants anymore. What I was really building was a <strong>data-driven automation platform</strong> for Kubernetes. It could do so much more than just tenant management!</p><p>So I decided to rename it to something that better captures what it does: <strong>Lynq</strong> - because it links your data sources to your Kubernetes resources. Plus, it sounds way better than &quot;TenantOperator&quot;, right?</p><p>The big rename happened in <strong>v1.1.9</strong>, and yes, it introduced breaking changes. But here&#39;s the thing - the project was only about two weeks old at that point, and I was literally the only person using it 😂 So no one got hurt in the process!</p><p>Going forward though, I promise to be more careful. Any breaking changes will be properly documented in <code>MIGRATION.md</code> or <code>BREAKING_CHANGES.md</code> files with clear upgrade paths.</p><p>Today, Lynq can connect to various data sources (starting with MySQL, PostgreSQL coming soon), and it&#39;s packed with policies and flexibility to handle most real-world scenarios I&#39;ve encountered in production environments.</p><h2 id="what-you-can-build-with-it" tabindex="-1">What You Can Build With It <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-you-can-build-with-it" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What You Can Build With It&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I&#39;ve collected some of my favorite use cases that show what Lynq can really do:</p><ul><li><a href="./use-case-blue-green.html"><strong>Blue-Green Deployments</strong></a>: Zero-downtime deployments controlled by database flags</li><li><a href="./use-case-custom-domains.html"><strong>Custom Domains</strong></a>: Give each node its own domain, automatically</li><li><a href="./use-case-database-per-tenant.html"><strong>Database-per-Tenant</strong></a>: Provision isolated databases on the fly</li><li><a href="./use-case-feature-flags.html"><strong>Feature Flags</strong></a>: Toggle features through database records</li><li><a href="./use-case-multi-tier.html"><strong>Multi-Tier Stacks</strong></a>: Complex architectures, automatically provisioned</li></ul><p>Check out the full <a href="./advanced-use-cases.html">Advanced Use Cases</a> guide for more inspiration.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Pro Tip</p><p>Honestly?
