## Development Workflow

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes
2. Add tests for new features
3. Update documentation
4. Run tests locally:
   ```bash
   make test
   make test-integration
   ```

5. Lint your code:
   ```bash
   make lint
   ```

### Running the Operator Locally

```bash
# Run against your Kubernetes cluster
make run

# Or with debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=debug make run
```

### Testing Your Changes

## Coding Guidelines

### Go Style

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Use `gofmt` for formatting (run `make fmt`)
- Use `golangci-lint` for linting (run `make lint`)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Keep functions small and focused

### Code Organization

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/v1/              # CRD definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/                 # Main application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/              # Kubernetes manifests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controller/      # Controller implementations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/        # Database clients
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template/        # Template engine
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apply/           # SSA apply logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ graph/           # Dependency graph
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ metrics/         # Prometheus metrics
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/                # E2E and integration tests
```

### Testing Guidelines

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions in isolation
  ```go
  func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T) {
      result := MyFunction("input")
      if result != "expected" {
          t.Errorf("got %s, want %s", result, "expected")
      }
  }
  ```

- **Integration Tests**: Test controller behavior with envtest
  ```go
  func TestControllerReconciliation(t *testing.T) {
      // Use testenv from controller-runtime
  }
  ```

- **Table-Driven Tests**: Use for multiple test cases
  ```go
  tests := []struct {
      name string
      input string
      want string
  }{
      {"case1", "input1", "output1"},
      {"case2", "input2", "output2"},
  }
  ```

### Error Handling

- Always return errors, don't panic
- Wrap errors with context:
  ```go
  if err != nil {
      return fmt.Errorf("failed to apply resource %s: %w", name, err)
  }
  ```
- Log errors appropriately:
  ```go
  logger.Error(err, "Failed to reconcile", "tenant", tenant.Name)
  ```

### Logging

Use structured logging:
```go
logger.Info("Reconciling tenant",
    "tenant", tenant.Name,
    "namespace", tenant.Namespace,
    "resources", resourceCount)
```

**Log Levels:**
- `Error`: Errors that need attention
- `Info`: Important informational messages
- `V(1).Info`: Debug information

# Run with coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./internal/controller
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Debugging

```bash
# Run with delve debugger
dlv debug cmd/main.go

# Or use your IDE's debugger (VSCode, GoLand)
```

### Useful Make Targets

```bash
make help              # Show all available targets
make generate          # Generate code (deepcopy, CRDs, etc.)
make manifests         # Generate Kubernetes manifests
make docker-build      # Build container image
make deploy            # Deploy to cluster
make undeploy          # Remove from cluster
